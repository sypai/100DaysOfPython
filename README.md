# 100 Days of Python Programming

I am starting a udemy course by Dr. Angela Yu : [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021](https://ibm-learning.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/lecture/17825426?start=0#overview)

This repository will be the home to my everyday progress. It'd be great if I can commit code daily.
